/**
 * Fails on a `src/features/*​/manifest.json` that the feature installer would choke on.
 *
 * The manifests are hand-maintained and nothing reads them until someone runs
 * `tsx cli/feature.ts <feature> install`, which is the worst moment to discover that a dependency
 * was renamed two months ago. Nine stale `required_by` entries had accumulated before this check
 * existed.
 *
 * Five checks:
 *
 * 1. **Parseable** — every manifest is valid JSON with the required fields and an `x.y.z` version.
 * 2. **Resolvable** — every `depends_on` names a feature that exists.
 * 3. **Satisfiable** — its version range accepts the version actually present.
 * 4. **Acyclic** — no dependency loop, which would make install order impossible.
 * 5. **Mirrored** — every real dependent appears in the target's `required_by`.
 * 6. **Grounded** — every `@/features/x` a feature imports appears in its `depends_on`.
 *
 * Only (5) is advisory at runtime: `feature.ts` finds reverse dependencies by scanning installed
 * manifests rather than trusting `required_by`, precisely because it drifts. It is still checked
 * here so the declaration means something. The reverse is not checked — a `required_by` entry with
 * no matching `depends_on` may legitimately record intent.
 *
 * (6) is deliberately **one-directional**: an undeclared import is an error, an unimported
 * declaration is not. Plenty of real dependencies leave no import behind —
 * `warehouse_movement.source_type = 'order_shipping_product'` is a polymorphic reference with no
 * foreign key and no import, seed ordering is expressed in `src/database/seed/index.ts`, and
 * `invoice` declares `cash-flow` ahead of the code that will need it. So the check can only ever
 * ask for a declaration to be added, never removed, and cannot be wrong about intent.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm run manifests:check
