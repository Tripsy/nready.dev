/**
 * Whether a polymorphic target still accepts what a reader is about to add to it.
 *
 * `comment`, `rating` and `complaint` all write against `(entity_type, entity_id)` and know
 * nothing about the tables behind those ids — deliberately, so a new target costs them nothing.
 * The switch that closes one of them, though, belongs to the target: an article carries
 * `allow_rating` / `allow_comments` / `allow_complaints`, and only the `article` feature knows
 * where they are stored or what they default to.
 *
 * So the dependency runs the same way as the `entityRemoved` listeners: the feature owning the
 * target registers a resolver for its own rows, and the feature doing the writing asks the
 * registry rather than the feature. Nothing here imports a feature, and no feature imports
 * another.
 *
 * **A target with no resolver is open.** That is the state of every one of them today except
 * `article` — a comment on a review, a rating on a comment — and it is what keeps this
 * additive: registering nothing changes nothing.
 *
 * Resolvers are registered from `*.bootstrap.ts` files, which `bootstrap.setup.ts` runs before
 * the server listens. That step is skipped in the `test` environment, so the registry is empty
 * there and every target reads as open; a test covering a closed one registers its own resolver.
