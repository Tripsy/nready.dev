/**
 * A received line — **and the FIFO lot it creates**. The two are the same row because a lot is
 * exactly "these units, at this cost, received on this day", which is what a receipt line already
 * says.
 *
 * `qty_remaining` is the authoritative on-hand figure. Quantity for a variant in a warehouse is
 * `SUM(qty_remaining)` over its open lots on confirmed receipts — a handful of rows, rather than a
 * replay of the whole ledger. `warehouse_movement` is the audit trail that explains how it got
 * there, and a reconciliation job compares the two and reports drift rather than silently
 * correcting it.
 *
 * FIFO consumes the oldest open lot first, so a sale of 14 against lots of 10 and 10 produces two
 * movements at two different costs. That is why the lot is recorded on the movement and never on
 * the order line: a line can only name one lot, and one line routinely spans several.
 *
 * **Pick order is `(grn.received_at, grn_item.id)`, and the tie-break is not optional.** Two
 * deliveries landing the same day tie on the timestamp alone, and an unordered pick would consume
 * different lots on a replay and report a different cost of goods for the same sale.
