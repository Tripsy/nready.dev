/**
 * The reader-facing half of the complaint feature, mounted under `/public/complaints` by
 * `complaint-public.routes.ts`. Documented separately from `complaint.docs.ts` because it is a
 * route module of its own — a different base path, a different controller, and no permission
 * check — even though both describe the same entity.
 *
 * A bearer token is required all the same: no permission is checked, but an account is. A
 * complaint accuses somebody, and an anonymous accusation is one nobody can be asked about.
