/**
 * Registers where the image standing for a row comes from, so a feature rendering a page can show
 * one without knowing that images live in a table at all — and so a deployment without this
 * feature simply shows none.
 *
 * The direction is inverted against `article.bootstrap.ts`: there the target registers an answer
 * about its own rows for other features to read; here this feature registers a lookup others
 * consume. Same rule underneath — the feature that owns the data owns the code, and the registry
 * is what the two sides share instead of an import.
 *
 * A section this table does not carry answers empty rather than failing: `section` arrives as a
 * plain table name, and a consumer asking for one nobody files images against is a deployment
 * fact, not an error.
 *
 * `TargetImageType` and `ImageType` are separate declarations of the same two values — the
 * duplication that keeps the registry importable without this feature. They meet here, and here
 * is where a divergence would stop compiling.
