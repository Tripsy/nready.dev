/**
 * What a product says about itself under a given label.
 *
 * The value lives in one of four columns, picked by the `value_type` of the
 * `product_category_attribute` definition that governs the label:
 *
 * | Source | Column |
 * |---|---|
 * | Taxonomy value shared across products | `value_term_id` |
 * | `number` | `value_numeric` |
 * | `string` | `value_text` |
 * | `boolean` | `value_boolean` |
 *
 * A number is stored bare — `330`, not `330 ml`. The unit is fixed by the definition and rendered
 * at read time, which is what lets a range query run against an indexed numeric column.
 * `value_numeric` keeps the figure as entered, for display; `value_base` carries it converted into
 * the dimension's base unit, and that is what filters compare. Storing both is what lets one
 * category quote a label in `ml` and another in `l` without a range spanning them going wrong.
 *
 * `value_term_id` is not a legacy of the other three. A term-backed value is a row other products
 * point at too, so renaming *Gluten* corrects every product at once and the Romanian catalog reads
 * from the same record as the English one; the scalar columns hold literals owned by this row
 * alone. Reach for the term whenever the value is a shared vocabulary rather than a measurement.

/**
 * Uniqueness splits in two, because the rule genuinely differs by value shape and a single key
 * cannot say both. A nullable `value_term_id` inside one unique index would say neither: Postgres
 * counts every NULL as distinct, so scalar rows would go entirely unconstrained.
 *
 * - Term-backed rows differ in `value_term_id`, so a product may list three allergens under one
 *   label — the cardinality `product_variant_attribute` deliberately forbids for itself.
 * - Scalar rows are keyed on the label alone, so it admits exactly one number, string or boolean
 *   per product. That is the right rule: a product has one volume.
 *
 * A multi-pick `checkbox` over a `string` list therefore cannot be one row per choice. It is a
 * single row whose `value_text` holds the joined selection, or a label promoted to term-backed
 * values.
