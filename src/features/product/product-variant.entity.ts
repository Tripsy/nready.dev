 * The purchasable unit. A product is the thing in the catalog ("Margherita", "Oxford shirt"); a
 * variant is what a customer actually puts in the basket ("Margherita, large", "Oxford shirt, M,
 * blue") and what a price is attached to.
 *
 * **Every product carries at least one variant, even when nothing varies.** A single-variant
 * product is the normal case, not a special one — the alternative, prices hanging off both the
 * product and the variant, means two places to look for the answer and a rule about which wins.
 * The service layer creates the default variant alongside the product.
 *
 * What distinguishes one variant from another is recorded in `product_variant_attribute`, so the
 * axes are whatever the catalog needs rather than a fixed size/color pair.
