/**
 * The reader-facing half of the comment feature, mounted under `/public/comments` by
 * `comment-public.routes.ts`. Documented separately from `comment.docs.ts` because it is a route
 * module of its own — a different base path, a different controller, and no permission check —
 * even though both describe the same entity.
 *
 * The bearer token is optional throughout rather than absent: commenting is open to guests, and
 * signing in changes who the request counts as, not whether it is allowed.
