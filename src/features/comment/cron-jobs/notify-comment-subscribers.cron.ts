 * approving a backlog in one sitting does not turn into a burst of notifications. The cost is
 * up to four hours of lag on a reply, which is the right way round for a discussion nobody is
 * watching live.
 *
 * Notification follows **approval**, unlike the subscription itself: a pending comment is not
 * public, and announcing it would leak what a moderator has not passed. `notified_at` is what
 * separates the two — a comment enters this queue when it is approved and leaves it when the run
 * has answered for it, whether or not anybody was actually written to.
