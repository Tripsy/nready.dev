 *
 * The rule lives here rather than in `complaint` because it is a rule about comments: what a
 * count of reports means, and what a comment does about it, is this feature's business. All the
 * event carries is the count — `complaint` knows how to count reporters, and nothing else.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget through `runInBackground`, so a failed flag logs instead of rejecting into
 * `server.ts`'s `unhandledRejection` handler, which would shut the API down. The complaints
 * themselves are already stored and sitting in the moderation queue, so nothing is lost when this
 * fails — the comment simply stays up until somebody acts on them.
