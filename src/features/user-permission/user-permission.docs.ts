/**
 * Which permissions a user holds. A row here joins a user to a `permission` row; the permission
 * itself grants nothing until one of these exists.
 *
 * Gated by the **`permission`** entity, not by `user` and not by an entity of its own: `create`
 * needs `permission` create, `delete` and `restore` need `permission` delete, `find` needs
 * `permission` find. Granting someone the ability to hand out permissions is the same decision as
 * letting them define one — which is also why these live on their own base path rather than under
 * `/users`, whose module answers to a different entity.
 *
 * Every write drops the target user's cached entry, because the permission set is baked into what
 * the auth middleware reads — so a grant or revocation takes effect on that user's next request
 * rather than when their token next expires.
