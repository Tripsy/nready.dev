 *
 * One table rather than one per target kind, for two reasons that matter more than the foreign
 * key it gives up:
 *
 * 1. **Direction.** A typed `category_discount` has to live in the `category` feature, which
 *    makes catalog features depend on `discount`. Discounts are the optional thing here; a
 *    shop should be installable without them. Owning the table on this side keeps every arrow
 *    pointing at `discount` and lets it stay a leaf.
 * 2. **One query.** The resolver asks "which discounts point at any of these things" for a
 *    basket line. Across five tables that is five round trips unioned in application code;
 *    here it is a single `WHERE (type, id) IN (…)` against one index.
 *
 * The cost is that `entity_id` carries no foreign key — it cannot, pointing at five tables —
 * so a deleted category can leave a row behind. Harmless (the resolver only ever matches ids
 * it was handed, so an orphan matches nothing) but it does accumulate, which is the trade
 * `operational_record` already makes.
