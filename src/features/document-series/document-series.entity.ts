/**
 * Numbering series and their counters.
 *
 * A series stores only what has to be allocated — the code and the running number. How the two
 * are rendered into a reference is a presentation choice and belongs to whatever displays it,
 * so there is no template or padding column here.
 *
 * A series runs continuously — there is no yearly reset. Restarting the counter would need the
 * year on the document too: references are keyed on (`ref_code`, `ref_number`), so the first
 * document of a new year would collide with the first of the old one.
 *
 * **No `deleted_at`**, so this does not extend `EntityAbstract`. `RepositoryAbstract` soft-deletes
 * by default and every query filters `deleted_at IS NULL`, which for a counter means the row
 * holding the last issued number quietly disappears while its `document_type` stays taken — an
 * allocation would then fail rather than continue. Deleting a series is a hard delete, and only
 * safe before it has issued anything.
