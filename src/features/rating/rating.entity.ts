/**
 * A row is the rating a visitor currently holds on one target, not a record of the moment they
 * cast it: the uniques below allow exactly one per owner per `(target, type)`, so a reader who
 * changes their mind edits that row rather than adding another. `created_at` is when they first
 * rated, `updated_at` when they last changed it.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** `EntityAbstract`: this table has no `deleted_at`. A withdrawn rating has to
 * leave the table outright — a soft-deleted row goes on holding its slot under both uniques, so
 * nobody at that address could ever rate the target again, and it would keep counting in the
 * aggregates. Both deletes are therefore hard, and there is no `restore` to pair with them.
 *
 * `type` is not editable. It sits in both uniques and decides which of `value` / `reaction` the
 * row carries, so a reader moving from stars to a like is casting a different rating, not
 * changing this one.
 *
 * A rating is rationed twice over — once per origin address and once per account — so both uniques
 * have to be reckoned with on write: an insert can collide on either, and the two say different
 * things to the caller ("you already rated this" against "this address already has").
 *
 * `user_ip_hash` is required on every row, signed in or not. A request whose address cannot be
 * resolved is rejected rather than stored under a fallback hash, which would collapse every such
 * request into a single shared vote per target.
