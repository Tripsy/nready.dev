/**
 * The reader-facing half of the rating feature, mounted under `/public/ratings` by
 * `rating-public.routes.ts`. Documented separately from `rating.docs.ts` because it is a route
 * module of its own — a different base path, a different controller, and no bearer token — even
 * though both describe the same entity.
 *
 * Every action is open to guests, so authorization here is an identity rather than a permission:
 * the caller's account when signed in, and always a hash of the origin address. A request whose
 * address cannot be resolved is refused with 400 rather than stored under a shared fallback,
 * which would collapse every such visitor into one vote per target.
