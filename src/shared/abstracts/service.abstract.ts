/**
 * Drops an entity's cached entries.
 *
 * **Cache invalidation belongs to the service and the repository terminals, never to a TypeORM
 * subscriber.** A row-level hook cannot do this job for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. *It fires per row.* Saving three translations broadcasts three identical cleans, each a full
 *    Redis SCAN over the same keyspace, all but the first finding nothing. The service knows the
 *    write was one operation on one article; the row-level hook cannot.
 * 2. *It fires inside the transaction.* A concurrent reader can slip between the subscriber's
 *    DELETE and the COMMIT, refill the cache from a snapshot that is about to be superseded, and
 *    leave it stale with no further write coming to correct it. Cleaning after commit closes that
 *    window; no amount of deduplication downstream can.
 *
 * **Awaited inside the request**, so the write is readable by whoever made it — the dashboard
 * re-reads an entry the moment its form submit resolves, and a clean handed to a background task
 * would let that read be answered with the entry it just replaced.
 *
 * Call it **after** the transaction commits. Inside one it reintroduces reason 2 exactly.
 *
 * @param {EntityWithCache} entity - Entity class whose `NAME` prefixes the cache keys
 * @param {number} id - Row whose keys should be dropped
